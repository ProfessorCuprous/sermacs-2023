    "## Fitting a Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To fit a linear equation to our data, we can use a library called [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html). \n",
    "`statsmodels` is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are numerous options for fitting data in Python, `statsmodels` is particularly beneficial when dealing with linear models. \n",
    "Note that this encompasses more than just \"linear equations\". \n",
    "This library is especially handy when you need straightforward access to fit parameters and in-depth statistical metrics related to the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are using a part of `statsmodels` called the formula API.\n",
    "The formula API lets you define a formula as a string for fitting and is specifically designed to work with dataframes.\n",
    "When defining a formula, you use the column names in a string to define the relationship.\n",
    "Note that the column names should not have spaces, or entering the relationship is a bit more complicated.\n",
    "For example, if we had data representing pressure and temperature at constant volume and expected them to follow a linear relationship such as for an ideal gas\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = \\frac{n R T}{V}\r",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we would write `\"P ~ T\"` when using the `statsmodels` formula API. \n",
    "This is assuming that our dataframe has columns named `P` and `T`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a slightly more complicatd eexample lone could also fit something like a polynomial using `\"y ~ np.power(x, 2) + x\"` if you had imported NumPy (`import numpy as n`). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the formula API, we will use `smf` (imported in first cell). \n",
    "We will use ordinary least squares (`ols`) for our fit, though [a number of other options are offered](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/api.html#statsmodels-formula-api).\n"
